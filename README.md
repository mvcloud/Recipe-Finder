# Welcome to the Recipe Finder!

## ***Description:***

All too often people get hungry and donâ€™t have a plan for dinner. They scour the pantry, only to find a set of ingredients they do not know what to do with. Trying to analyze all the ingredients and think of a recipe can take lots of time and energy. Instead of spending time searching through recipe books, our program searches a set of 20,000 recipes to help determine the best meals to make.  By inputting a list of what ingredients you have and the max number of ingredients you want to use, the program will return a plethora of recipes that use the most amount of ingredients already on hand within the constraint.  


## ***Technologies Used:***

This program was written in C++. Within the program, we parse through a CSV file and the graphics are from the SFML library. 

## ***Challenges:***

We ran into trouble figuring out how to implement a destructor at the end of our program, which led to us restructuring our code. At the beginning, we struggled to decide what containers to use to store our data and what algorithms to implement for the most optimal and cohesive design.

## ***How to install:***

Download the files and put it into your local IDE. Also, download the SFML library and make sure it is integrated before you run the project. If everything is set up correctly (sprites/files in the files folder and SFML is running), this project will be able to work for your computer.

## ***How to use this project***

First, press the space bar to begin. Then, the program will ask which sorting algorithm you would like to use and you will also input the max number of ingredients you wish for the recipe to have. Then, you will type the ingredients you have at hand and click the beckbox when done. The program will sort through the data set and give you recipes that have ingredients that match what you entered. You can go back and forth between recipes and click the checkboxes next to each ingredient. When you decide on a recipe, click the "i choose this recipe" checkbox and begin!! when you are done, click the sprite in the top left corner to be taken to a closing screen then exit from there.
